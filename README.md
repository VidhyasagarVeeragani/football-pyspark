## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess raw FIFA player data using PySpark
- Perform transformation and create meaningful features (UDFs, Spark SQL)
- Save optimized data using Parquet
- Convert to Pandas for plotting
- Visualize player stats, trends, and distributions

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

| Library/Tool     | Use Case |
|------------------|----------|
| **PySpark**      | Distributed data processing, DataFrame operations |
| **Pandas**       | In-memory manipulation, easier plotting |
| **Matplotlib**   | Data visualization (plots, bar charts, etc.) |
| **Seaborn**      | Advanced statistical plots |
| **Parquet**      | Efficient file format for storing large structured data |

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

### 1. ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning (01_ingest_clean.py)
- Dropped records with missing player names or key metrics
- Replaced null salary/value fields with 0
- Exported cleaned data to `.parquet`

### 2. ðŸ”„ Transformation & Querying (02_transform_query.py)
- Created a UDF to convert currency strings (e.g., "â‚¬105M") to numeric
- Derived new fields:
  - `is_top_player`: Boolean for high-rated players (Overall â‰¥ 85)
  - `age_bucket`: Categorized age groups
- Executed Spark SQL queries to compute player counts per nationality

### 3. ðŸ“ˆ Visual Insights (03_visualize_or_insight.ipynb)
- Converted Spark DataFrame â†’ Pandas for plotting
- Visualized:
  - Top 10 player nationalities
  - Average overall ratings by age bucket
  - Age vs Wage scatter plot
  - Top 10 most valuable players
