üß† Project Goals
	‚Ä¢	Clean and preprocess FIFA player dataset using PySpark
	‚Ä¢	Apply user-defined functions (UDFs) for currency conversion
	‚Ä¢	Perform statistical analysis and transformations
	‚Ä¢	Generate insights and visualizations using Pandas + Seaborn

üìä Features & Highlights

1. Data Cleaning (01_clean_and_store.py)
	‚Ä¢	Dropped nulls in essential fields: long_name, age, club_name, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Replaced missing numeric values (value_eur, wage_eur) with 0
	‚Ä¢	Saved cleaned data to Parquet for efficient I/O

2. Transformation & Querying (02_transform_query.py)
	‚Ä¢	Wrote a PySpark UDF to convert currency fields from ‚Äú‚Ç¨105M‚Äù to float
	‚Ä¢	Added new columns:
	‚Ä¢	is_top_player: Players with Overall >= 85
	‚Ä¢	age_bucket: Categorized players into Teen, 20s, 30s, 40+
	‚Ä¢	Performed aggregations and grouping:
	‚Ä¢	Average stats by nationality
	‚Ä¢	Correlation between Age and Wage_EUR
	‚Ä¢	Used Spark SQL for player nationality distribution

3. Visualization (03_visualize_or_insight.ipynb)
	‚Ä¢	Converted Spark DataFrame to Pandas
	‚Ä¢	Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to plot:
	‚Ä¢	Top 10 countries by player count
	‚Ä¢	Average rating by age bucket
	‚Ä¢	Age vs Wage scatter plot (highlighting top players)
	‚Ä¢	Top 10 most valuable players
